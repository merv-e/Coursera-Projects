# Coursera Projects

Each project here is a part of the program below:

Therefore, hereby I confirm that none of the above project belongs to me. I have only participated this MOOC as a student and sharing these as a proof of what I've learnt so far. 

### Advanced Converter

With this project, it's possible to convert km to mile or the opposite. You need to type how many miles/kilometres you'd like to convert, click "convert distance" and that's it!

 The program comes with "miles to kilometres" by default. However, you are able to change it to "kilometres to miles" only by clicking "K" letter on your keyboard and that will switch the converter. If you would like to change the converter into "miles" again, this time you need to press "M".
