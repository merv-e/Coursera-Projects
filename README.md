# Coursera Projects

Each project here is a part of the program below:

Therefore, hereby I confirm that none of the above project belongs to me. I have only participated this MOOC as a student and sharing these now as a proof of what I've learnt so far. 

---------------------
### Advanced Converter

With this project, it's possible to convert km to mile or the opposite. You need to type how many miles/kilometres you'd like to convert, click "convert distance" and that's it! The result will appear in the blue block underneath.

 The program comes with "miles to kilometres" by default. However, you are able to change it to "kilometres to miles" only by clicking "K" letter on your keyboard and that will switch the converter. If you would like to change the converter into "miles" again, this time you need to press "M".

 ### Advanced Slide Show
Change pictures by clicking "previous" and "next". Even though it sounds simple, you need to manipulate DOM for this, and sometimes, things get a bit tricky!

### Vacation Destination

Here's the final exercise in this splendid MOOC! This website is designed for you to add your favorite destinations on a wishlist.

Fill the form and submit it. Let's say you've added many of places to the list. But then, you've changed your mind, you can of course remove the ones, you'd like!

Technologies used for these projects are : HTML, CSS & JavaScript (particularly DOM manipulation)
